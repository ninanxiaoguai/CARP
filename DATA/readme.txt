Sources of benchmark instances

Thanks to Prof Stefan Irnich (https://logistik.bwl.uni-mainz.de/forschung/benchmarks/) and Prof José Manuel Belenguer (https://www.uv.es/belengue/carp.html), the benchmarks bbcm, gdb, kshs, egl, egl-large, bmcv are collected and transformed into the standard format.
The two real-world datasets of large instances, Hefei and Beijing, were provided by Prof. Ke Tang (SUSTech).
